# RomCollection
### A collection of ROMs for RetroPie and other emulators.




## Install (RetroPie)

#### Important
I RECCOMMEND USING LAKKA! You need a computer, and lakka is simpler then RetroPi.

INSTEAD OF EXECUTING THIS COMMAND ON THE LAKKA DEV(which wont work) EXECUTE ON COMPUTER

Then, use Network Share OR usb share to copy onto the Pi.

#### First Time Install:

`cd ~/RetroPie/roms/ && git init && git remote add origin https://github.com/Shugabuga/RomCollection.git && git pull origin master`

#### Update After First Install:

`cd ~/RetroPie/roms/ && git pull origin master`
